# HW_DCMI
[中文](./README_CN.md)

Huawei Ascend computing device **third-party** DCMI c library **safe** FFI binding

- hw_dcmi provides safe FFI bindings (encapsulated from the FFI bindings provided by hw_dcmi_sys)
- hw_dcmi_sys provides unsafe FFI bindings (directly generated by bindgen)

## Usage
### Prerequisites
project has been tested on Ubuntu 22.04, with Atlas 6.0.0 DCMI API, you need to install the following dependencies:

- DCMI shared library
- Ascend driver

by default, library will try to find `dcmi_interface_api.h` and link `libdcmi.so` in `/usr/local/dcmi`,
you can provide `HW_DCMI_PATH` env variable to specify the path of the dcmi shared library.


### Feature flag
- `serde`: enable serde serialization and deserialization for all types in hw_dcmi
- `load_dynamic`: enable dynamic loading of the dcmi shared library

## **Project Status: Work in progress**
